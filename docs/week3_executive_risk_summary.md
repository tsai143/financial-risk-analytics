\# Executive Risk Summary — Portfolio Forecast



\## Objective

To assess potential future portfolio risk using Monte Carlo simulation

based on historical return behavior and asset correlations.



\## Methodology

\- 1-year forecast horizon (252 trading days)

\- Equal-weighted diversified portfolio

\- Correlation preserved using covariance matrix



\## Key Risk Metrics

\- Value at Risk (95%): Indicates expected maximum loss under normal conditions

\- Value at Risk (99%): Represents extreme downside risk

\- Worst Case Return: Simulated extreme stress scenario

\- Probability of Loss: Likelihood of negative portfolio return over 1 year
